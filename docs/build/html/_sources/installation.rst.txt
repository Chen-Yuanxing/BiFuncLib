installation
=========================


Install from PyPI
------------------
It is recommended to use ``pip`` for installation. You need to check the upgrade at the beginning:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install --upgrade pip

Then you can instll this package using the code:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install BiFuncLib

You can also use the installation method for a specified version.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install BiFuncLib==0.0.1


Install from source
---------------------

If you want to work with the latest development version or wish to contribute to **BiFuncLib**, this way will be suitable.

Clone the latest source code from GitHub and navigate into the directory of the cloned project:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/XMU-Kuangnan-Fang-Team/BiFuncLib.git
   cd BiFuncLib

Run the following command to install the project:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install .

Alternatively, if you want to install the project in development mode (which will install the project along with all development dependencies), you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .

If you prefer to use the setup.py script to install, you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

   python setup.py install
