Methods and Main Functions
======================================

In this section, we present the methods included in the package and their corresponding functions.
For in-depth methodological details, please refer to the cited literature;
our focus here is on function design, outputs, and visualization.

Each method comprises three modules: **simulated data**, **model construction**, 
and **visualization**. We provide detailed explanations of the functions within each module, 
along with their usage and outputs, on the corresponding method page.
